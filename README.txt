This is to generate you own musicpack for Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe
You need exactly 31 midi files to get the .obm file to work
the root folder should look like this
#############################
Root
	create.py
	music(folder)
		mymusic.obm
	submithere(folder)
		the 31 midi's needed
#############################
put the 31 midi's in the music folder
just drag and drop the music folder in C:\Users\USERNAMEGOESHERE\Documents\OpenTTD\content_download
the python script will do the rest
the scritp is portable
you just need to install python 3.9

its that simple.

Note: The file will fix any invalid filenames to be used in the game

	-Bulk Pack Making
