This is to generate you own musicpack
You need exactly 31 midi files to get the .obm file to work
the root folder should look like this
#############################
Root
	create.py
	music(folder)
		the 31 midi's needed
#############################
put the 31 midi's in the music folder
just drag and drop the music folder in C:\Users\USERNAMEGOESHERE\Documents\OpenTTD\content_download
the python script will do the rest
the scritp is portable

its that simple.
