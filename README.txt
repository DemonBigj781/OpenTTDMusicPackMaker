This is to generate you own musicpack for Open Transport Tycoon Deluxe
You need all 31 midi files to get the .obm file to work
the root folder should look like this
#############################
Root
	create.py
	music(folder)
		the 31 midi's needed
#############################
put the 31 midi's in the music folder
just drag and drop the music folder in C:\Users\USERNAMEGOESHERE\Documents\OpenTTD\content_download
the python script will do the rest
the scritp is portable
you just need to install python 3.9

its that simple.

Note: the midi filenames needs to have no spaces and have no odd characters that are not on the us keyboard. It will only go to 31 entries and cut off the rest in a sudo alphetical order from special characters to charactars to numbers and from first to last character but only for files with the .mid extention.

Planed features:
	-Bulk Pack Making
	-Pull from Midi databases
	-Music Picker
